# PBL #2

- Due: Sunday 03, December, 2017

## Description

The PBL #2 (Stage-2) consists in recognize traffic signs 

## Instructions

- Improve Stage #1, if it is necessary 
- Train a classifier to determine if the blobs are traffic signs or not 

## Tips

1. Generate your dataset first
2. Then add to code

## Evaluation

Grade = 0.5 Code * 0.5 Presentation

#### Code

1. 1, if traffic recognition precision is lower than 50 %
2. 4, if traffic signs are recognized using SVM and pixels as input
3. 5, if 2, and another classifier is tested that improve previous result 
4. 6, If 2 and 3, and another feature is used to train the classifier
5. 7, Optionals + mandatory + good quality code

#### Presentation 

1. 10 minutes max  
2. Describe solution 
3. Give priority to analysis of results (+ and -)
4. Show results

## Submission

1. Submissions are through Platea.
2. Submission must include the file train.py compressed as a zip file
3. Submission must include the slides (presentation)
4. The zip file must be named pbl_2_rut.zip

## Bonus

1. 0.5 points is bug in the code are found
