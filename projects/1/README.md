# PBL #1

- Due: Wednesday 01, November, 2017

## Description

The PBL #1 (Stage-1) consists in segment traffic signs using color clues

## Instructions

- Improve Stage #0 results using mathematical morphology
- Improve previous parameters is allowed

## Tips

1. Use joblib to implement multiprocessing
2. Use OpenCV for color segmentation

## Evaluation

Grade = 0.5 Code * 0.5 Presentation

#### Code

1. 1, if nothing works
2. 4, if mathematical morphology is used, and improve previous results 
3. 5, if connected componets filtering techniques are used, and improve previous results (optional)
4. 6 If 2 and 3, and the code can run using multiple processors (optional)
5. 7, Optionals + mandatory + good quality code

#### Presentation 

1. 10 minutes max  
2. Describe solution (algorithm)
3. Give priority to analysis of results (+ and -)
4. Show results

## Submission

1. Submissions are through Platea.
2. Submission must include the file train.py compressed as a zip file
3. Submission must include the slides (presentation)
4. The zip file must be named pbl_1_rut.zip
