# PBL #1

- Due: Sunday 29, October, 2017

## Description

The PBL #1 (Stage-2) consists in segment traffic signs using color clues

## Instructions

- Improve Stage #1 results using mathematical morphology
- Improve previous parameters is allowed

## Tips

1. Use joblib to implement multiprocessing
2. Use OpenCV for color segmentation

## Evaluation

Grade = 0.5 Code * 0.5 Presentation

#### Code

1. 1 If nothing works
2. 4 If mathematical morphology is used, and improve previous results 
3. 6 If 2, and the code can run using multiple processors (optional)
4. 7, Optionals + mandatory + good quality code

#### Presentation 

1. 10 minutes max  
2. Describe solution (algorithm)
3. Give priority to analysis of results (+ and -)
4. Show results

## Submission

1. Submissions are through Platea.
2. Submission must include the file train.py compressed as a zip file
3. Submission must include the slides (presentation)
4. The zip file must be named pbl_1_rut.zip
